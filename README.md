# Monetize

To get started making your own art, first clone the repo locally.

``` $ git clone https://github.com/BrianLim167/advancedplacementphysicsc.git ```

**Instructions**

To try our project, you must have Processing and Java installed. To run, open the "art" folder within the repo, and double click "art.pde" to open Processing. Press ctrl + R to run. You should see an image of yourself on the screen given you have a webcam. Once you get into picture position, Press "w" for watercolor, or "s" for stained glass. This will generate an impression in the selected style with a random color palette. Press "d" for default if you want to use the original colors. You can press the up and down arrow keys repeatedly to blur or focus the art. Have fun transforming yourself into art!
